<p>The ashram is located on a tranquil property in the lap of Mother Nature, situated next to an ever-murmuring river called Giri Ganga. Tall, lofty mountains, lush green valleys and a starlit sky are the silent keepers of this ashram. The ashram is not open year-round as we currently do not have the necessary resources to provide the basics to its visitors. Gradually, as more infrastructures is built, we will be able to open it for longer duration. Please check out the Events page to see the dates when the ashram is open for you to visit. This serene ashram is in Himachal Pradesh, about 30 kilometers from Solan or roughly 100 kilometers from Chandigarh.</p>
